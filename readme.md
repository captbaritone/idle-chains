Generate [Idle Thumbs](https://www.idlethumbs.net/idlethumbs) podcast descriptions using Markov Chains.

To run:

    python markov.py

You will need to have [installed NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/install.html) and [downloaded the punkt data](http://www.nltk.org/data.html) for it.

Python 2 also requires the [future library](http://python-future.org/).
